# Fundamentals of Computing

A compilation of all the C related programs I have built at school.

## How to compile the program

1. Move the C file in the root directory and its dependent files.
2. Run the following command `nodemon --exec "gcc -o file_name file_name.c && ./file_name > output.txt" file_name.c`

## Description of Programs

This repository contains various programs written in C, showcasing different aspects of programming like data structures, algorithms, and basic computational logic. Each program is designed to provide a practical understanding of key concepts in computer science.

## Contents

- `program1.c`: Description of what this program does.
- `program2.c`: Description of what this program does.
- ... (add descriptions for other programs as needed)

## Requirements

- GCC Compiler
- Nodemon (for automatic compiling and running)

## Installation

To set up the required environment:
1. Install GCC: [Instructions here](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)
2. Install Nodemon: Run `npm install -g nodemon`

## Usage

After setting up the environment and moving the desired C file to the root directory:
1. Replace `file_name` with the name of your C file in the compile command.
2. Run the compile command as described above.
3. The output will be saved in `output.txt` in the root directory.
